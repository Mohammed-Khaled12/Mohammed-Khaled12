# Hi, I'm Mohamed Khaled 👋

**Intelligent Systems Engineering Student | System Programming Enthusiast**

I'm a sophomore engineering student focused on problem-solving, low-level programming concepts, and building a solid foundation in software architecture.

### 🎯 Current Focus
- 💻 Solving complex algorithmic problems and training in competitive programming (FEHU-CPC) using **C++**.
- 🏗️ Deep diving into **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and system-level execution.
- 🐧 Mastering Linux environments, bash scripting, and CLI tools as my daily driver on **Ubuntu**.
- 🌱 Building a comprehensive **Digital Garden** in **Obsidian** to systematically document problem-solving patterns, core CS concepts, and daily learnings.
